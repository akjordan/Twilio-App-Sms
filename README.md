*Send a link to your app directly to a mobile device*

This code demonstrates how easy it is to allow a web form on your site to deliver a link to your app directly to a user's mobile device.

We reccomend sending a link that checks for the User-Agent of your user and then forwards them to the appropriate app store or download link for their OS.
